## Introduction

The **Alarm Clock in Python** is a simple yet powerful desktop alarm clock application developed using Python. It leverages the following Python libraries: `tkinter`, `datetime`, `time`, `threading`, and `playsound` to create an intuitive graphical user interface for setting and managing alarms.

This repository contains all the source code and necessary resources to run the alarm clock application on your local machine.
